      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="https://zurihac.com/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <h2 id="about-us">About us</h1>
    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

      Occasionally, we reach out to our members with volunteering opportunities. Also, once a year we would send you an email to confirm and update the membership.

I am therefore forwarding this invitation on the HaskellerZ meetup.</p> <p>Best regards<br/>Farhad</p> <p>\-\-\-</p> <p>**Lecture "Free Software and Your Freedom" Dr. Richard Stallman - Monday[masked]:00 Aula OST-Rapperswil**</p> <p>Threats to personal freedom through software are an increasing concern. It is my pleasure to announce the following talk given by Dr. Richard Stallman. Many of you may already know of Dr. Stallman as the founder of the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF), as well as his work on GNU Emacs, and the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc).</p> <p>Title: Free Software and Your Freedom</p> <p>Abstract: The Free Software Movement campaigns for computer users' freedom to cooperate and control their own computing. The Free Software Movement developed the GNU operating system, typically used together with the kernel Linux, specifically to make these freedoms possible in practice for computer use.</p> <p>Speaker Bio: Dr. Richard Stallman launched the free software movement in 1983 and started the development of the GNU operating system (see [www.gnu.org](www.gnu.org)) in 1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and redistribute it, with or without changes. The GNU/Linux system, basically the GNU operating system with Linux as the kernel, is used on tens of millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper Award and the ACM Software and Systems Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well as many doctorates honoris causa, and has been inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.</p> <p>The lecture will take place in person on Monday[masked] in the Aula of the OST campus in Rapperswil-Jona (Oberseestrasse 10, 8640 Rapperswil). You are welcome to arrive and take your seats from 17:00. The lecture will start at 17:15. There will be a presentation of about 45 minutes, followed by sufficient time for questions and discussion. We plan to end at around 19:15. The lecture will be in English.<br/>In case you are interested in attending, we request you to register with your email address (please input your complete email address in the "Your name" field) on the following poll by the end of Thursday[masked]:</p> <p>[<a href="https://nuudel.digitalcourage.de/lecture-rms-ost](https://nuudel.digitalcourage.de/lecture-rms-ost" class="linkified">https://nuudel.digitalcourage.de/lecture-rms-ost](https://nuudel.digitalcourage.de/lecture-rms-ost</a>)</p> <p>Registration is not required to attend, but it helps us with planning, and allows us to contact you in case of any changes. Please feel free to bring others, and forward this invitation to others who may be interested. The lecture is aimed at a general audience, and will not be technical. The lecture will be recorded, and may be made publicly available.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing you there.<br/>Best regards,<br/>Farhad Mehta</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/299591887/">Cazim Hysi: We&#39;re all already using Comonads</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/299490906/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/297196479/">Zurihac 2024: Organizer Meering</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/296893251/">Auke Booij: What are exact real numbers?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/296055315/">Dominic Egger: Dynamic Logic for verifiable data collection processes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/294293599/">Eliane Schmidli: Hardware Control using Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/293928592/">(External) D.

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.com">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
