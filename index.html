      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="https://zurihac.com/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

      Occasionally, we reach out to our members with volunteering opportunities. Also, once a year we would send you an email to confirm and update the membership.

Christiansen: Programming and Proving with Dependent Types &amp; Lean</a><p class="meetup-time">Tuesday  6 June, 10:00</p><p>This event will be a guest lecture given by David Thrane Christiansen for the Computer Science department at OST Rapperswil, which we are happy to announce has been opened to interested members of HaskellerZ.</p> <p>While most programming languages allow types to take other types as arguments, as in List Int and List String, dependent types allow any program to appear in types. The type of lists can describe not only what type each entry in the list has, but also how many there are, and the type of the append function can state that the length of the resulting list is the sum of the lengths of the input lists. Dependent types are powerful enough that they can be used as logic in which to prove arbitrary mathematical theorems. This lecture will provide a hands-on demonstration of programming and proving with dependent types in Lean, an interactive theorem prover developed at Microsoft Research.</p> <p>David has been doing functional programming for twenty years, and he's been working with dependent types for a decade. Together with Daniel P. Friedman, he wrote _The Little Typer_, a dialog-form introduction to the key ideas of dependent types. He is also the author of Functional Programming in Lean, a free online book about using the Lean theorem prover as a programming language. He has contributed to the dependently typed language Idris and worked in industry on program analysis tools, election security, secure parsing of binary formats, and domain-specific languages for the financial sector. Since May 2022, he is the Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/292642066/">Marco Perone: Crem -- Composable Reproducible Executable Machines</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291582150/">Soham Chowdhury -- The State of Error Messages in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291569318/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290693286/">Eliane Schmidli: An Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and Yampa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hambüchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li></ul></div></div>

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.com">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

<p>
  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  contains all our Haskell-related videos.

  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
