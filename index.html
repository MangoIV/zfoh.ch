      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="https://zurihac.com/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <h2 id="about-us">About us</h1>
    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

The general assembly gives you the opportunity to learn what the association has been doing in the year 2022 and to contribute to ZuriHac, the HaskellerZ meetup, and the Haskell community in Zurich.</p> <p>This assembly marks the fifth year of the association. As in past years, the board and further volunteers have been working hard to keep the association and its events alive. With the COVID measures being lifted in the course of 2022, we were able to hold events in person again. It was great to meet in person for ZuriHac 2022 and for the HaskellerZ meetup and I’m happy to say that we will be able to hold the general assembly 2023 in person as well.</p> <p>Note, the general assembly will take place right before the HaskellerZ meetup, **starting from 6pm**. If you wish to attend both events, the general assembly and the HaskellerZ meetup, then **please RSVP to both events**.</p> <p>The general assembly is open to all members of the ZFoH. If you are not a member yet, please head over to[ <a href="https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch" class="linkified">https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch</a>) and **sign up for membership**.</p> <p>The agenda is as follows:</p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2022.<br/>2. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2022.<br/>3. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2022.<br/>4. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2023.</p> <p>Please let us know, if you have further topics you would like to discuss.</p> <p>Note, members of the ZFoH will receive a separate invitation via email. Please RSVP to this meetup event anyway so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thank you!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you at the GA!</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290693286/">Eliane Schmidli: An Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and Yampa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hambüchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/278365645/">Francesco Mazzoli - Quick and dirty backpropagation in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/277626304/">Simon Michael - Inside hledger: an architectural tour and how-to</a></li></ul></div></div>

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.com">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
