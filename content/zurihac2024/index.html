<h1>What is ZuriHac?</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> community
    event in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival co-organized by
    the <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">ZÃ¼rich Friends of Haskell</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en">OST Eastern Switzerland University of
    Applied Science</a>.
    It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but
    features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your
    favourite projects, and of course lots of socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 8 June â€” Monday 10 June</strong>
    2024 as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a> located right next to lake ZÃ¼rich.
    We hope to see you there!

<h1 class="color1">Schedule</h1>
<section>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is primarily a community event and a hackathon, rather than a
    conference.  Aside from the talks and tracks, attendees are encouraged to
    work together on all sorts of Haskell-related open-source projects and
    socialize.  Trying to attend everything may a bit too much, just pick
    what you find interesting!
  </p>
  <p>
    This schedule is tentative and minor changes may still need to happen as
    we get closer to the event.
