They compose nicely in several ways and they admit a graphical representation, which allows one to easily understand how they work without looking at their implementation.</p> <p>Crem is a Haskell library to build and run state machines in a compositional way allowing you to generate a graphical representation out of your machine implementations.</p> <p>In this talk, we will go through the ideas which made Crem possible. Expect a bit of Domain-Driven Design, some type-level hackery and some nice state machine diagrams!</p> <p>As usual, there will be an opportunity for food, drinks and discussion after the event.</p> <p>\-\-\-\-\-</p> <p>Our speaker this time is Marco Perone. Marco is a software developer, and grew up as a mathematician. He loves to bring in my code the same formalism and precision you can find in math.</p> <p>He is particularly interested in functional programming and how to introduce and apply its ideas in non-functional languages and its links with domain modelling. He is an open source explorer and author of projects such as [lamphpda](<a href="https://github.com/marcosh/lamphpda" class="linkified">https://github.com/marcosh/lamphpda</a>), [haskell-training](<a href="https://github.com/tweag/haskell-training" class="linkified">https://github.com/tweag/haskell-training</a>), [servant-template](<a href="https://github.com/tweag/servant-template" class="linkified">https://github.com/tweag/servant-template</a>) and, of course, [crem](<a href="https://github.com/tweag/crem" class="linkified">https://github.com/tweag/crem</a>).</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291582150/">Soham Chowdhury -- The State of Error Messages in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291569318/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290693286/">Eliane Schmidli: An Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and Yampa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hamb√ºchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/278365645/">Francesco Mazzoli - Quick and dirty backpropagation in Haskell</a></li></ul></div></div>
