The general assembly gives you the opportunity to learn what the association has been doing in the year 2022 and to contribute to ZuriHac, the HaskellerZ meetup, and the Haskell community in Zurich.</p> <p>This assembly marks the fifth year of the association. As in past years, the board and further volunteers have been working hard to keep the association and its events alive. With the COVID measures being lifted in the course of 2022, we were able to hold events in person again. It was great to meet in person for ZuriHac 2022 and for the HaskellerZ meetup and I’m happy to say that we will be able to hold the general assembly 2023 in person as well.</p> <p>Note, the general assembly will take place right before the HaskellerZ meetup, **starting from 6pm**. If you wish to attend both events, the general assembly and the HaskellerZ meetup, then **please RSVP to both events**.</p> <p>The general assembly is open to all members of the ZFoH. If you are not a member yet, please head over to[ <a href="https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch" class="linkified">https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch</a>) and **sign up for membership**.</p> <p>The agenda is as follows:</p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2022.<br/>2. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2022.<br/>3. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2022.<br/>4. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2023.</p> <p>Please let us know, if you have further topics you would like to discuss.</p> <p>Note, members of the ZFoH will receive a separate invitation via email. Please RSVP to this meetup event anyway so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thank you!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you at the GA!</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290693286/">Eliane Schmidli: An Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and Yampa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hambüchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/278365645/">Francesco Mazzoli - Quick and dirty backpropagation in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/277626304/">Simon Michael - Inside hledger: an architectural tour and how-to</a></li></ul></div></div>
