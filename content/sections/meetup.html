Most such applications are programmed in a low-level imperative style, forcing the programmer to think about multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously.</p> <p>Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) proposes an approach that is declarative and therefore more modular and composable. Initially suggested in 1997 by Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak, the idea of FRP has since then undergone several iterations and is now used in a variety of application areas.</p> <p>In this talk, Eliane will introduce us to the basic ideas behind FRP as they were originally proposed, show its evolution over the years, and end with some examples of how this could be used today within the Yampa framework in Haskell.</p> <p>As per usual, there will be an opportunity for food, drinks and discussion after the event.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hamb√ºchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/278365645/">Francesco Mazzoli - Quick and dirty backpropagation in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/277626304/">Simon Michael - Inside hledger: an architectural tour and how-to</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/276345161/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/275826446/">Alexey Kuleshevich - Haskell&#39;s new random package interface</a></li></ul></div></div>
