This enables the expressive typing that Haskell is best known for, but this information also has potential beneficial uses in improving error messages and, in turn, the development experience.</p> <p>In this talk, Soham will discuss how existing errors across both GHC and the library ecosystem can be made easier to find and make use of, and highlight approaches to contextual error messages and domain-specific code suggestions that have the potential to bring us closer to the oft-stated goal of a development experience where the compiler is not an antagonist but a collaborator.</p> <p>As usual, there will be the opportunity for drinks and food after the event.</p> <p>Please note that this event will take place immediately after our annual general assembly. If you wish to attend both events, please RSVP to both!</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291569318/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290693286/">Eliane Schmidli: An Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and Yampa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hamb√ºchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/278365645/">Francesco Mazzoli - Quick and dirty backpropagation in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/277626304/">Simon Michael - Inside hledger: an architectural tour and how-to</a></li></ul></div></div>
