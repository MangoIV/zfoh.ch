Christiansen: Programming and Proving with Dependent Types &amp; Lean</a><p class="meetup-time">Tuesday  6 June, 10:00</p><p>This event will be a guest lecture given by David Thrane Christiansen for the Computer Science department at OST Rapperswil, which we are happy to announce has been opened to interested members of HaskellerZ.</p> <p>While most programming languages allow types to take other types as arguments, as in List Int and List String, dependent types allow any program to appear in types. The type of lists can describe not only what type each entry in the list has, but also how many there are, and the type of the append function can state that the length of the resulting list is the sum of the lengths of the input lists. Dependent types are powerful enough that they can be used as logic in which to prove arbitrary mathematical theorems. This lecture will provide a hands-on demonstration of programming and proving with dependent types in Lean, an interactive theorem prover developed at Microsoft Research.</p> <p>David has been doing functional programming for twenty years, and he's been working with dependent types for a decade. Together with Daniel P. Friedman, he wrote _The Little Typer_, a dialog-form introduction to the key ideas of dependent types. He is also the author of Functional Programming in Lean, a free online book about using the Lean theorem prover as a programming language. He has contributed to the dependently typed language Idris and worked in industry on program analysis tools, election security, secure parsing of binary formats, and domain-specific languages for the financial sector. Since May 2022, he is the Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/292642066/">Marco Perone: Crem -- Composable Reproducible Executable Machines</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291582150/">Soham Chowdhury -- The State of Error Messages in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/291569318/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290693286/">Eliane Schmidli: An Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and Yampa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/290365386/">Niklas Hamb√ºchen: Writing a tool to graph job postings on r/haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/287391031/">Alex Drake: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Monad</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286586638/">Cazim Hysi: Why is Haskell Haskell?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/286686292/">NixOS Users Zurich (Re)inaugural Meetup</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/284041064/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li></ul></div></div>
