The general assembly gives you the opportunity to learn what the association has been doing in the year 2023 and to contribute to ZuriHac, the HaskellerZ meetup, and the Haskell community in Zurich.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it looks like we may find ourselves short on volunteers to continue the function of the Zurich Friends of Haskell association. Participating in the ZFoH is a great way to meet other Haskellers. You don't need to be an expert Haskeller to contribute, a bit of enthusiasm for Functional Programming is all that's required. If you are interested, then please fill in the following poll to indicate in which areas you would be interested to contribute: [<a href="https://forms.gle/Pj8ko354qmEmhyyw9](https://forms.gle/Pj8ko354qmEmhyyw9" class="linkified">https://forms.gle/Pj8ko354qmEmhyyw9](https://forms.gle/Pj8ko354qmEmhyyw9</a>)<br/>The general assembly is open to all members of the ZFoH. If you are not a member yet, please head over to[ <a href="https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch" class="linkified">https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch</a>) and sign up for membership.<br/>The agenda is as follows:</p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2023.<br/>2. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2023.<br/>3. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2023.<br/>4. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2024.<br/>5. We elect the board for the next two years.</p> <p>Please let us know, if you have further topics you would like to discuss.<br/>Note, members of the ZFoH will receive a separate invitation via email. Please RSVP to this meetup event anyway so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thank you!<br/>Looking forward to seeing you at the GA!</p> <p>Please note that there will be a regular HaskellerZ talk immediately after the GA.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/297196479/">Zurihac 2024: Organizer Meering</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/296893251/">Auke Booij: What are exact real numbers?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/296055315/">Dominic Egger: Dynamic Logic for verifiable data collection processes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/294293599/">Eliane Schmidli: Hardware Control using Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/293928592/">(External) D.
