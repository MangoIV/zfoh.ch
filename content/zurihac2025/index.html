  <h1>What is ZuriHac?</h1>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> community
    event in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival co-organized by
    the <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en">OST Eastern Switzerland University of
    Applied Science</a>.
    It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but
    features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your
    favourite <a href="/zurihac2024/projects/">projects</a>,
    and of course lots of socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 7 June — Monday 9 June 2025</strong>
    as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a> located right next to lake Zürich.
    We hope to see you there!
